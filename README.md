# Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction Notebooks

Welcome to the Customer Segmentation and Churn Prediction Repository! This collection of notebooks is designed to assist you in exploring and understanding customer behavior through segmentation and predicting churn in a business context.

## Notebooks

1. **EDA_part1.ipynb:** Begin your journey with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in part 1, where you'll delve into the dataset, examining its structure, handling missing values, and performing preliminary analysis.

2. **EDA_part2.ipynb:** Continue your exploration with part 2 of Exploratory Data Analysis. Dive deeper into the data, identify patterns, and extract meaningful insights to inform subsequent steps in the analysis.

3. **customer_segmentation.ipynb:** Explore methods and techniques for segmenting customers based on various characteristics such as demographics, purchase history, and engagement metrics.

4. **customer_churn.ipynb:** Build and evaluate a churn prediction model using machine learning algorithms. Understand the key features influencing churn and implement strategies to mitigate potential losses.
